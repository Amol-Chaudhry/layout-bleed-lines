# Layout Level Bleed

In printing, bleed is printing that goes beyond the edge of where the sheet will be trimmed. 

To facilitate it, my task was to develop an algorithm to draw guiding lines at the border of a document that can be used as a reference by the user for bleed.

In this feature, I made the user interface to enter the Bleed values and saved those values in a preferences file for keeping them retained when the user relaunches the application. Further, I used those values to draw lines on the screen bordering the document. These lines are helpful in the case of printing and this feature was used by almost 18,000 users which upgraded to the 16.1 version.
